# TreeSkeleton
A simple class that partially implements a Tree from Jake Wharton's Timber library, allowing users to easily send logs to third-party services.

Extend TreeSkeleton and implement ```log()```, ```logException()```, ```logWarning()```, and ```logGenericThrowable()``` to handle logs however you want. CrashlyticsTree provides an example, and a simple way to log to Crashlytics.
